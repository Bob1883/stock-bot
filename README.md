A stock bot with website made in python and flutter.

The website is not mobile friendly.


If the code crashes, it is probably because the Google WebDriver is on the wrong version. Additionally, you need to add an .env file if you want to run the code.


The flask server is hosted on Google cloud, and the flutter website is hosted on netlify.
